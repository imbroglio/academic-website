I am a Ph.D. candidate in Actuarial Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), supervised by [Prof. Mario Ghossoub](https://sites.google.com/site/marioghossoub/).

My current research focuses on studying how risk is allocated among different agents within an economic framework. Specifically, I study the structure of Pareto optima and market equilibria, as they are affected by different models of agent preferences, market structure, etc. I am broadly interested in quantitative risk management, and its intersection with economics and mathematical finance.

I am honoured to receive the [James C. Hickman Scholarship](https://www.soa.org/resources/announcements/press-releases/2022/2022-hickman-scholar/) from the Society of Actuaries. My research is also supported by the Government of Ontario through the [Ontario Graduate Scholarship Program](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html).

I am actively pursuing the [Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA)](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/edu-asa-req/) designation and have completed all required exams.
